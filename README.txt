This is a public build of the expenditure calculator.
It is a full-stack application built using React as the front-end and Node.js as the backend, with MongoDB being the DBMS of choice.
The app itself is a React built to graph and chart your personal expenditures to see how much expenses can pile up and see which ones are not needed.

To run it, please install Node.js, MongoDB and NPM if you haven't already.
Simply run "npm i" to install all of the dependencies and run "node app.js" to run it.

For the production version, it is hosted on mLabs and the configuration file ("/config/db_mlab.js") is not included. Feel free to make you own mLabs instance.
Similarly, the public and private RSA keys are not included and feel free to generate your own in the config folder.
