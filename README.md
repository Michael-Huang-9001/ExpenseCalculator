This is a public build of the expenditure calculator.

It is a full-stack application built using React as the front-end and Node.js as the backend, with MongoDB being the DBMS of choice.
The app itself is a React app built to graph and chart your personal expenditures to see how much expenses pile up and see which ones are not needed or which ones take up the most.

To run it, please install Node.js, MongoDB and NPM.

Simply run "npm i" to install all of the dependencies.

To run the development version, run "npm start" to start the client and "node app.js" to start the server.

To run the production-ready version, simply run "NODE_ENV=production node app.js".


For the production version, it is hosted on mLabs and the configuration file ("/config/db_mlab.js") is not included. 

Similarly, the public and private RSA keys are not included and feel free to generate your own in the config folder.
